<!-- 
  This is the main entry point for the website.
  Its sole purpose is to redirect the user to the primary content page (`zosinfo.html`).
  Web servers (like GoDaddy, Apache, etc.) are configured to look for `index.html` by default
  when a user visits the root of a domain (e.g., https://www.your-site.com).
  This file ensures that your site loads correctly without needing to change server configurations.

    <!-- 
      This is the core of the redirection. 
      - `http-equiv="refresh"` tells the browser to refresh the page.
      - `content="0; URL=zosinfo.html"` specifies the refresh delay (0 seconds) and the destination URL.

    <!-- The canonical link is important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It tells search engines
         that `zosinfo.html` is the "main" or "canonical" version of this content, preventing
         duplicate content penalties. -->
